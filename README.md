# Java Desktop Swing Application for Electricity Billing with MySQL JDBC Connectivity

## Project Description

This GitHub project demonstrates an electricity billing software application built using Java Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI) and MySQL JDBC for database connectivity. The application provides a user-friendly interface for managing electricity bills, customer information, and payment records, with robust backend integration for seamless database operations. The combination of Swing and MySQL JDBC ensures an efficient experience for both users and developers.

## Key Features

1. **User-Friendly GUI with Swing**:
    - **Responsive Design**: Create a dynamic and interactive user interface using Java Swing components such as JFrame, JPanel, JButton, JLabel, JTextField, JTable, and more.
    - **Bill Management**: Implement forms for data entry, updates, and deletions related to electricity bills, customer information, and payment records.
    - **Real-time Feedback**: Provide real-time feedback to users through message dialogs and status indicators.

2. **Database Connectivity with MySQL JDBC**:
    - **Database Operations**: Establish a connection to a MySQL database and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using JDBC.
    - **Prepared Statements**: Utilize prepared statements to prevent SQL injection and ensure secure database transactions.
    - **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to manage database connectivity issues and SQL errors.

3. **Data Management**:
    - **Customer Information**: Manage customer details such as names, addresses, contact information, and billing records.
    - **Bill Generation**: Generate electricity bills based on consumption data and tariff rates.
    - **Payment Tracking**: Track payments and update billing records accordingly.
